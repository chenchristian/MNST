# MNST

MNIST Neural Network from Scratch (C++)
This project implements a basic neural network for digit recognition using the MNIST dataset, built entirely from scratch in C++ without external libraries. It includes key components of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) such as:

Convolution Layers for feature extraction

ReLU Activation for non-linearity

Max Pooling for dimensionality reduction

Fully Connected Layers for classification

Softmax Function for digit prediction


Features
âœ… Reads and processes raw MNIST data
âœ… Implements forward propagation with convolution and pooling
âœ… Uses a hand-crafted neural network without libraries

Future Improvements
ðŸ”¹ Backpropagation & Gradient Descent â€“ Implement a training mechanism to adjust weights dynamically
ðŸ”¹ Optimization Techniques â€“ Introduce momentum, learning rate decay, or Adam optimization
ðŸ”¹ More Activation Functions â€“ Add support for Sigmoid, Tanh, or Leaky ReLU
ðŸ”¹ Multithreading â€“ Speed up computations using parallel processing
